        This project showcases my frontend development skills using React. It
        features client-side routing with React Router, state management via
        Redux, and state persistence using Redux Persist. A key part of the app
        is user registration and authentication with a connected backend,
        demonstrating my understanding of API integration, handling server
        responses, and securely managing tokens. The project is built with
        scalability and code readability in mind. I hope it serves as a solid
        example of my approach to building modern web applications.
